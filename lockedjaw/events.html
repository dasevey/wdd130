              Great pictures of they boys just hanging out and having a good time!
              Thanks Jane for planning this party we had such a good time!  Looking

              Those boys were at the chip table for a long period of time!
              I took this pictures of evidence of them running for said table.
              I must admit that even during a strenuous time that I am able to
              take a great picture.  It was all happening so fast and the 
              adrenaline hit me hard, I think instinct just took over.

            <span class="instance_author">by John Doe</span>
            <span class="instance_paragraph">
              I was on the beach and I was feeling like man I wanted some chips
              but there was no chips!!! I was awful, one of my favorite things
              about beach birthdays is the different flavors and nuances of the
              chips.  This rare occurrence only happens on the beach. Well, I 
              started talking to Elliot and Matt and they made me realize that
              it's not about the chips, it's about the lasting relationships
              that you make with the people at the party.  I decided to not focus 
              on the chips and decided to start making connections with the 
              people around me and it turned out pretty good.
