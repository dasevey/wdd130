            <h3>Social Media w/ a Twist</h3>
        <p class="first_paragraph">
            Locked Jaw is an event manager with a social media twist.  This works in a very intuitive way, you can invite guest to your event.
            They don't even need an account.  The events manager then keeps track of what needs doing and who needs to do it.  It then captures 
            pictures, stories and comments related to that event!
        </p>

            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p class="first_paragraph">
            All you need to do is put in a date and a title.  The events manager can send invites out through email, text, some social media accounts.
            It will then keep track of tasks and due dates.  It will send out reminders to all parties involved.  All you have to do is set it up and 
            then forget about it.  Will do all that pesky reminding stuff.

                Picture/Video Sharing
            </h3>
            <p>
                This can be done from someones existing social media account or directly from their phone.  They don't need an account to share
                pictures for your event.  Locked Jaw collects all the pictures taken for your event and stores them.  You can delete any you
                don't like.

            <h3>

            </h3>
            <p>
                Any guest can share a story to this event, no account needed.  They can share something that memorable that happened to them at
                the event.  They can type it out or record audio and then share it.
