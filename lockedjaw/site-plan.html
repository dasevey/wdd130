      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wanted to go onto social media and just connect with people?  Oftentimes it can be challenging to go onto a 
          platform such as Facebook without getting bombarded with the viewpoints of coworkers and people we felt obligated to add to our friends list.  
          With family circle, a social media platform I'm currently developing, you are able to prioritize who your family and close friends are and 
          create a network around them.  This gives the user full control through a simple and easy to use interface.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience will mostly be geared to parents aged 30-50 and also older people 55+.  Though we will try to make this appealing to the younger crowd
          by having some type of quick upload status like something found on instagram or snapchat.  The appeal to the parents will be to have a safer web environment
          for children and also allow them to connect with relatives and close friends.  The appeal for the older community is a close connection to family members
          by prioritizing posts.  The websites theme will be a priority of people versus advertising.

      <p>
        Locked Jaw is a new quasi social media website dedicated for families.  We like
        to think about this as a scheduler with social media elements.  Take for instances
        a birthday party.  You're not the only one taking pictures, anyone associated with
        the event can setup through the app to automatically share pictures.  You will have a family
        page that you allow to see and interact with these events.
